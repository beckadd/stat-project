abstract = "This paper examines the ability of financial variables to predict future economic growth above and beyond past economic activity in a small open economy in the euro area. We aim to clarify potential differences in forecasting economic activity during different economic circumstances. Our results from Finland suggest that the proper choice of forecasting variables is related to general economic conditions. During steady economic growth, the preferred choice for a financial indicator is the short-term interest rate combined with past values of output growth. However, during economic turbulence, the traditional term spread and stock returns are more important in forecasting GDP growth. The time-varying predictive content of the financial variables may be utilized by applying regime-switching nonlinear forecasting models. We propose a novel application using the negative term spread and observed recession as signals to switch between regimes. This procedure yields a significant improvement in forecasting performance at the one-year forecast horizon."

title={The usefulness of the median CPI in Bayesian VARs used for macroeconomic forecasting and policy},

abstract={In this paper, we investigate the forecasting performance of the median Consumer Price Index (CPI) in a variety of Bayesian Vector Autoregressions (BVARs) that are often used for monetary policy. Until now, the use of trimmed-mean price statistics in forecasting inflation has often been relegated to simple univariate or "Phillips-Curve" approaches, thus limiting their usefulness in applications that require consistent forecasts of multiple macro-variables. We find that inclusion of an extreme trimmed-mean measure--the median CPI--improves the forecasts of both core and headline inflation (CPI and personal consumption expenditures price index) across our set of monthly and quarterly BVARs. While the inflation forecasting improvements are perhaps not surprising given the current literature on core inflation statistics, we also find that inclusion of the median CPI improves the forecasting accuracy of the central bank's primary instrument for monetary policy--the federal funds rate. We conclude with a few illustrative exercises that highlight the usefulness of using the median CPI.},
